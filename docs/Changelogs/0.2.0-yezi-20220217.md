#### Revamping

- **New sections to the library.** As part of revamping the old Archivist website, we've added new sections in order to better sort and access files and documents. `Important Documents (Criminal Code, Constitution, and Standing Rules); Judicial (); Executive (); Congress ().` These files will are currently in the process of being filled with documents.

- **New colors, new titles.** Every section now has it designed index that has the documents listed almost like a glossary but more advanced. The website's color was changed from a light blue to a dark (aqua) blue to better view the headers and contracts with dark mode.
